## [0.25.0] - 2021-04-15
## Added
- New `com.starter.library.multiplatform` plugin for KMM projects

## [0.24.0] - 2021-04-11
## Changed
- The `issuechecker` dependency has been moved from `jcenter()` to `mavenCentral()`
- `kapt` is not enabled automatically by default
- Update Kotlin plugin to [1.4.32](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.4.32)

- **Breaking:** Quality plugin can't be disabled anymore. The dependency has been added either way, so the plugin will now always create quality realated tasks.
- **Breaking:** Changed default release tag format for new projects. This change follows `axion-release-plugin` convention.
- **Breaking:** The plugin has been now divided into multiple smaller artifacts. The change is breaking only if the legacy plugin application is used.   
`com.project.starter:plugins` can now be replaced with `com.project.starter:jvm` or `com.project.starter:android` or just `com.project.starter:quality`.  
  Applying just `jvm` project doesn't require adding `google()` repository dependency anymore.
- The plugin is now compatible with Gradle 7.0  

#### Known bugs
- It is not possible to override `com.starter.versionin` plugin config. The workaround is to set the project version manually, after updating its configuration.
